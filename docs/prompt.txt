Cursor Build Prompt: Lane-Switching Car Game with Sports Knowledge (Expo / React Native)
1. App Overview

Build a native mobile car game using Expo + React Native where the player controls a car that switches lanes to avoid obstacles on a scrolling road.

The game integrates open sports knowledge APIs (soccer, basketball, baseball) in a creative way. Sports data appears as power-ups, trivia events, visual collectibles, or score modifiers during gameplay. The goal is to combine fast arcade gameplay with lightweight sports knowledge.

The app must:

Run on iOS, Android, and Expo Web

Be mobile-first and touch-optimized

Be deployable to Vercel (Expo Web)

2. Technical Requirements

Framework: Expo (React Native)

Language: TypeScript

Routing: expo-router or React Navigation

State Management: React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)

Game Loop: requestAnimationFrame or setInterval

Animations: React Native Animated API or Reanimated

API Fetching: fetch or axios

Platform Support: iOS, Android, Web

Deployment: Vercel

3. Core Game Mechanics

Infinite vertically scrolling road

3 lanes (left, center, right)

Player car switches lanes using:

Swipe left / right

Or on-screen buttons

Obstacles spawn randomly and move downward

Collision with obstacle ends the game

Speed and obstacle frequency increase over time

Score increases based on survival time and collectibles

4. Features
Gameplay

Lane switching

Obstacle avoidance

Progressive difficulty

Score and high score tracking

Game over and restart flow

Sports Knowledge Integration

Fetch sports data from open APIs

Sports items appear on the road as:

Power-ups (shield, slow obstacles, score boost)

Trivia collectibles

Supported Sports

⚽ Soccer

🏀 Basketball

⚾ Baseball

5. API Specification

Use free, open sports APIs such as:

TheSportsDB (Recommended)

Base URL: https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/3

Example endpoints:

Soccer teams: /search_all_teams.php?l=English%20Premier%20League

Basketball leagues: /all_leagues.php

Baseball teams: /search_all_teams.php?l=MLB

Usage in Game

Fetch sports data on game start

Cache results in state

Randomly assign sports facts to collectible items

Display sport icon + fact when collected

6. Styling & UX

Dark road background with lane dividers

Bright arcade-style obstacles and collectibles

Sports collectibles use:

Ball icons (soccer, basketball, baseball)

Team or league colors

Smooth animations (target 60 FPS)

Minimal UI chrome during gameplay

Responsive layout for Expo Web
